There are 7 layers needed for secured communication between two systems called as OSI model(Open system interconnection

1. Application -> may be  my web browser and other  end it may be web server

2. Presentation -> in this layer encryption and decryption takes place

3. session -> this makes sure that what we have asked for is delivered, it maintains the connection till we are done for Ex: we are downloading the 
              video and in between network is lost and after the networl comes it will start from where it stopped, So that was done by session layer
             
4. Transport -> to communicate with two devices we need to create a connection between them, so that was done by this layer

5. Network -> suppose we are communicating in India to America server then it doesn't pass directly, it goes through various devices that is router
              and many other things that is done by  this layer,  this uses the IP address of the system to identify it
              
6. Datalink -> this layer makes sure that every bit is transferred and no bit is lost, if any bit is lost then server datalink will say that some of
               your bit is lost, So send again that packets which contains the bits, here machine is identified by MAC address
               
7. Physical -> this is the actual medium where the data is transferred for Ex: cable etc


In TCP/IP protocol 1,2,3 of OSI model layer is combined as one and it is called as Application layer

and datalink layer and physical layer is combined and it is called as Netwrok Access Layer

TCP/IP model : 

1. Applcation layer -> Ex : HTTP, FTP, SMTP, POP

2. Transport layer -> TCP -> TCP is like telephone that is first making a connection and then commmunication
                   -> UDP -< this is like post, it may receive or may not receive but it keeps on communicating
                   
3. Network Layer ->IPv4 or IPv6 -> may be 4 or 6 byte IP adrress of a device and it may vary 

4. Network access layer ->Ethernet -> uses MAC address which is fixed for a device
