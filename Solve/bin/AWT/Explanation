* There are two types of interface -> 1. Character user interface(DOS),    2. Graphical User Interface(like we can see and feel)

* Java Provides 3 types of frameworks for developing GUI 
   1. Abstract window Interface(AWT) -> this one is outdated but it is still present in java
   2. Swings -> nearly outdated
   3. Java FX -> latest framework, If you learn AWT then other 2 will be very easy to learn as it is almost similar
   
* In AWT if you see the border or a window then we call it as frame-> it provides various componenets close button, minimize button, title, 
  logo area,, check box, radio button, canvas(canvas is used for drawing), label, menu bar
  
* heirarchy of classes -> there are two classes component and Menu component, these both are inheriting from Object class

* There are many classes under component -> where all the sub classes will have all the functions which are present in Component class

There are 5 points for AWT

1. It is Platform Dependent -> Because it is buying the gui from the corresponding OS, its look and feel is dependent on the installed OS.
                               Then why Abstract WT name is given, that is because it is having abstract classes, for xome exception,
                               they have created the class too
                               
2. HeavyWeight -> Because it has to interact with the OS to build the GUI

3. Few Components

4. Host Look and Feel -> It has the look and feel of the OS that java is running

5. No MVC
