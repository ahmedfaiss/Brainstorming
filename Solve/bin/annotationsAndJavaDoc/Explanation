JavaDoc

*we can  do a site where everything about something is written beautifully by HTML
etc same way we can organize things neatly by documentation
*So we no need to learn HTML or any other  thing instead java provides us a simple
way to create a documentation by using tool called JavaDoc
* where we have to provide some neatfull information and java created the document
* so creating a documentation java provides set of tags which is given below

	  class 						Methods							Others

	 @author					    @param							@link
	 
	 @version                       @return						    @value
	 
	 @since                         @throws							@serial
	 
	 @see                          @exception
	 
	 							  @deprecated
	 							  
	 							     @code

* for documentation you have to use /**, /* is for commenting and double * is for
documenting


* the Documentation files will be created inside javadoc folder , where HTML file
and many other files will be created
