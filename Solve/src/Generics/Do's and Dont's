Do's and Dont's in Generics

1. Only extends is allowed in generic class definition
2. extends is used for interfaces also
3. extends from only one class and multiple interfaces -> i,e -> if you are extending a class and interfaces then class
   class should be first and interfaces should be the next one and it extend only one class and multiple interfaces 
   (For Ex: <? extends a & b & c>, where a is class and b, c are interfaces, if a is interface and b is class then compiler
   will throw an error.) (you can extends interfaces at first only if you are not extending a class).
4. extends and super is allowed with <?> in methods
5. <?> will accept all types but cannot access
6. Base type of an object should be same or <?>
