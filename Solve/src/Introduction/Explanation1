* To Compile and execute we require JDK, which has JRE and JVM
* JDK has compiler and run time environment
* once you write the program you have to compile it and which is present inside JDK, and once compiling, you have to execute it
* So JRe is present inside the JDK and inside JRE we have class libraries and JVM
* To execute we need JVM
* "Javac" is used to compile the Java program by using the development kit present inside JDK and and to run that we have to use keyword
  "java" and name of the program excluding .class extension, which uses the JVM present inside the JRE(i,e JVM) and also if needed used 
  class libraries present inside JRE
* JVM is an Interpreter
* The main method is a static because without creating the object jvm directly calls main method, it calls as first.main(), here first is a 
  program name so it can be different
  
* java.lang is automatically imported if we don't import also, So it contains classes like System etc

* you can have class name and file name different only if you don't write as public, So if you don't write public then you can compile the program using
  file name and run using class name there is no issues there
  
* If you give class name as public then both class and file name should be same or else it will give an error, (usually in CMD) but if you are using
  compiler then it will throw an error if you don't write public
  
* The java should have main method in -> public static void main(String[] args) only -> if you remove the parameters then it will throw an error while
  running, but you can compile the program without writing  the parameter(String [] args), but you can't run
  
* here args[] takes the command line arguments if you define the inside the program

* you can use _ in the long or double or float value, only in between but not at the end

* Unicoded are present in unicode.org website

* Merging means doing an OR operation to check some conditions like how much bits are set to 1
* Masking means doing and Operation to check whether the any one number is set to 1 or not
