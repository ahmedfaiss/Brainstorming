//* String is immutable, that is you cannot modify the same object, If you modify then new
//object will be created, As it is immutable it is faster
//* StringBuffer is mutable, extra methods of this is append, insert
//capacity if String buffer may be increased based on the inputs we give
//* StringBuffer is Thread safe, it means that more than 2 threads cannot utilize the same
//StringBuffer object simultaneously, StringBuufers are synchronized that is
// 2 Threads can not use same insert or append etc methods at the same time, Because
// of this it is  little slower, So to make it faster we use StringBuilder
//* StringBuilder same as StringBuffer, only the thing is it is not Thread safe, So
//it will allow more than one Threads to enter inside or call the method
