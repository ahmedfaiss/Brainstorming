* Java Proram can Store, retrieve and modify data from the file, but storing will be in done by java on its own, IF we write name as first
  then name should be retrieved first you can't retrieve other data instead of name, thats how File works in HDD
  
* Database is not like File, it stores data in a table form bbyt he help of SQL, where each table can have the relation to other table, and also 
  we can retrieve data as we want
  
* So how to write store data in a table inside a database, that is by using the database Program(SQL) in java Program is called as 
  Java Data Base Connectivity(JDBC)
 
* That means Java program accessing the Database by writing the database Program


                                                           TERMINOLOGY
                                                           
1. Relation -> that is having a relation between 2 tables, for Ex : in first table there contains a column Age, and in other table also there
               contains a as column, So both tables are interconnected, Database is also called as RDMS
           
2. Schema -> In the Top row the description of the table for each column will be there it is called as Schema, For Ex: age, based on this we 
             update the row
  
3. Record -> The full row of a Table is called as Record where deatials would be available

4. Field -> The whole column is called as Field

5. Primary Key -> This is actually refers as Unique value and is not null, for Ex: roll No -> it can't be null and it will be unique

6. Relationship -> It is similar to Relation but with slight change that is, for Ex : in the first tabe RollNo and DeptNo is available and
                   in the second table DeptNo and DeptName, So DeptNo is same in both the table which has some unique numbers and in the both 
                   the table the numbers are same, So by using the Roll No, we can get the DeptName which are present in the second table with
                   the use of DeptNo in the first table.
                   
7. Foreign Key -> For Ex: considering the above table, we have RollNo as Primary key in the first table and DeptNo as Primary key in the second
                  table, and DeptNo is present in the both table so DeptNo in the first table is a Foreign key, that is which is Primary Key in
                  the one table and is common in the other table, So that column is called as Foreign key
                  
8. Contraints -> It is called as rules -> For EX : For Primary key -> it shouldn't be null and it should be uniques is the contraints
                 and also for foreign key -> both the table should have same values, and one table can't have some unique values, and other
                 having different values
