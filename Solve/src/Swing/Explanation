Java introduced Swing because 

1. Swing is Platform Independent -> the GUI components is not borrowed from OS, it has its OWN component like Jbutton, Jmenu

2. Light Weight -> The interaction with OS is less

3. Many components are available

4. Pluggable Look and Feel -> which ever you run the application it has its own Look and Feel

5. Support MVC


* All the classes provided as part of swing by java is called Java Foundation Classes(JFC)


Extra Components -> 1. Color chooses, label Icon, can create Tabs, Frames inside a Frame,

1. Metal Look and Feel, Nimbus Look and Feel, 


* Here Close button will work, and it will close the Frame, but application won't close, you have to close forcefully

* Here we have to use method that is available in the swing which closes the frame plus application

J Component is a Parent class of Swing
